    "* Commands are used in a program called a <b>command shell</b>. What your type goes into the shell, which then figures out what commands to run and orders the computer to execute them.

    "Nelle Nemo, a marine biologist, has just returned from a six-month survey of the North Pacific Gyre, where she has been sampling gelatinous marine life in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. She has 300 samples in all, and now needs to:\n",
    "* Run each sample through an assay machine that will measure the relative abundance of 300 different proteins. The machine’s output for a single sample is a file with one line for each protein.\n",
    "* Calculate statistics for each of the proteins separately using a program her supervisor wrote called <b>goostat</b>.\n",
    "* Compare the statistics for each protein with corresponding statistics for each other protein using a program one of the other graduate students wrote called goodiff.\n",
    "* Write up results. Her supervisor would really like her to do this by the end of the month so that her paper can appear in an upcoming special issue of Aquatic Goo Letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes about half an hour for the assay machine to process each sample. The good news is that it only takes two minutes to set each one up. Since her lab has eight assay machines that she can use in parallel, this step will “only” take about two weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bad news is that if she has to run goostat and goodiff by hand, she’ll have to enter filenames and click “OK” 45,150 times (300 runs ofgoostat, plus 300*299/2 (half of 300 times 299) runs of goodiff). At 30 seconds each, that will take more than two weeks. Not only would she miss her paper deadline, the chances of her typing all of those commands right are practically zero.\n",

    "The next few lessons will explore what she should do instead. More specifically, they explain how she can use a command shell to automate the repetitive steps in her processing pipeline so that her computer can work 24 hours a day while she writes her paper. As a bonus, once she has put a processing pipeline together, she will be able to use it again whenever she collects more data."
